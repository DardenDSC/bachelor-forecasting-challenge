    " \n",
    "To use a B-school example, let's say that we want to forecast the sales of a product (our response variable) based upon our ad spend for that product and the ad spend our competitor's equivalent product (our two predictor variables). Here's some sample data for 5 months of sales:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sales - $ Y $ | Our Ad Spend - $ X_1$ | Competitor's Ad Spend - $X_2$ |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 62,543 | \\$1,045,000 | \\$1,932,000 |\n",
    "| 64,567 | \\$1,206,000 | \\$2,130,000 |\n",

    "| 63,996 | \\$1,305,000 | \\$2,005,000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above data, we want to estimate future sales as accurately as possible using the data we have on hand (our ad spend and our competitor's ad spend) we so can optimize our ad spend to maximize profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, this is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X) $\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    " - $ \\hat{Y} $ : prediction for our output variable (AKA **response variable**), so in this example, the response variable is unit sales\n",
    " - $ X $ : a matrix of our **predictor variables** (each variable is column in this table, each row is a month of data on ad spend)\n",
    " - $ \\hat{f}(X) $ : our **function** that will transform our input variables into our output variable\n",
    " \n",
    "**Note**: The little hats over the letters in the notation mean \"estimate\". We are estimating future values of $Y$ (our predictions) by coming up with our best estimate of the \"true relationship\" ($f$) between our predictor variables and our response variable. We denote this \"best estimate\" with $\\hat{f}$, since we are trying to estimate the true function itself. Think of it like when Isaac Newton was coming up with his best approximation for the law of gravitation. He found a nearly perfect representation of the gravitational attaction between two objects using their masses and distance between them as predictor variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "$ Y = \\hat{f}(m_1, m_2, R) $\n",

    "\n",
    "It wasn't until centuries later that Einstein found something that more was closer to the \"true relationship\" with his theory of general relativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prediction and Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part of machine learning is using different approaches to estimate the \"true function\" $f$ using past data. Why do we care about this? Estimating $f$ allows us to do things: **prediction** and **inference**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction** - We care less about interpretting the practical meaning of $\\hat{f}$ and care solely about the predictive accuracy of our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inference** - We care more about interpretting the relationships between our predictor variables and our response variable. We could use this information to ask future strategic questions to improve outcomes, such as understanding the underlying relationship between ad spend and unit sales in order to maximize profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference often goes hand in hand with **explainability**, or the relative ease of which a data scientist can explain how the model is making predictions and interpret the relationships between predictor variables and the response variable. Certain modeling methods are inherently more complex than other, but often can lead to more accurate results. Thus, we have this inverse relationship between accuracy and explainability, as shown below:"

In this case, about only 6.1% of the variability in the data can be explained by our model. The other 93.9% is explained by other information that we did not incorporate into our model, such as:\n",
    " - contestant height\n",

Using the rule of thumb that $\\pm$ 2 standard deviations will cover about 95% of the possible estimates of each coefficient, we can infer a lot from looking at the standard error. Looking at the `First_Impression_Rose`, our model says that our estimate for the impact that getting the first impression rose has on a contestant's duration on the show could be $3.4495 \\pm 2*0.699$ weeks, or anywhere between 2.05 and 4.85 weeks. \n",

    "Looking at `Age_Difference`, our model says that the impact of a contestant having a 1 year larger age difference with the Bachlor could result in them staying between -0.0433 and 0.0767 weeks longer. This helps us build intuition that age difference probably does not make a big difference on how long a candidate stays on the show, since the model isn't even sure if they will stay longer or shorter because of an increase in age difference!\n",
    "\n",

For example, we can write a **null hypothesis** (written as $H_0$) for each of our predictor variables in the model stating that *there is no relationship between the predictor and the response variables*. This is equivalent to saying that a regression coefficient $ \\beta_j = 0 $. We compare the null hypothesis with the **alternative hypothesis** (written as $H_A$), which would be the *there is some relationship between the predictor and response variable.*\n",

We can use the p-value to help us interpret which of our predictor variable(s) has a \"significant\" relationship with the response variable.\n",

    "Next up, we have another type of linear model, **Penalized Regression**. Penalized regression builds off of Linear Regression by including a *penalty term* for adding new features to our model. Why might we want to penalize ourselves for adding new features? Adding more features to our model increases the **complexity** of our model, which can be potentially detrimental to our modeling efforts as data scientists by overfitting our model to our data. Eliminating unnecessary complexity from our model helps us improve *prediction accuracy* on unseen data and *model inference* by eliminating unimportant features. Think of this concept like [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor), where the simplest possible explanation is usually the best one.\n",

    " - **Varance** - how much a given prediction will vary depending on the training data we give our model\n",

Penalized regressions have a built-in way to limit complexity, namely by **shrinking** (AKA **regularizing**) the impact that a predictor variable has within a model by reducing the value of the coefficient. If you want a mathematic explanation, read below. If not, just remember that penalized regressions will shrink the values of our model's coefficients closer, if not all the way, to zero (depending on the type of shrinkage). (Insert bad George Costanza meme here).\n",

    "## Standardized Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To run our penalized regression techniques, we have to do a bit more data manipulation first. Because we are planning on shrinking some of the coefficients in our model to 0, we need to **standardize** our data so that all of our predictor variables are within roughly the same magnitude. For instance, `First_Impression_Rose` can only take on a value of 0 or 1, while `Hometown_Distance` can theoretically range from 0 to 1000s of miles. From our earlier example, we saw that `First_Impression_Rose` had a coefficient of about 3.5, while `Hometown_Distance` had a coefficient of -0.0002, yet both were significant at a level of $ \\alpha \\leq 0.1 $. The differences in magnitidue of the coefficients is largely because of the difference in scale between the two variables. Thus, it would be much easier to shrink `Hometown_Distance`'s coefficient to zero than `First_Impression_Rose`'s because it's so much closer to zero, and that's simply due to the difference in scale between the two predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for this, we need to standardize our data so each column has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. That way, all of our data will have the same scale and we won't have to worry about the some variables being more easily penalized than others.

    "Unlike with Linear Regression where we were only estimating **model parameters** (the $\\beta$ coefficients), we now also have to estimate the value of our **complexity parameter** $\\lambda$. We can think of complexity parameters a way to *change the amount of complexity in a model* whereas model parameters are ways that we optimally fit a model to our data *given a fixed level of complexity*. Complexity parameters are more high-level than model parameters and have a large impact on how well a model can generalize to new data. Because complexity parameters have such a large impact on model performance, we need to find the optimal value for our complexity parameter(s) *before* finding our optimal model parameters.\n",

Right now, we do not have any \"unseen data\" (AKA **test data**) since the new season has not finished and we don't know the outcomes of the show. Instead, we can *hold out* some of our data from our training set and keep it hidden from our models to simulate a test data set! We call the data we show our models **training data** and the data we withold from our models **validation data** since we are using this to validate or assess the performance of our different models and to find out which model performs best on unseen data.\n",

    " - **Test Data**: Future data that we will feed into our best model to make predictions. This data will not have values for our response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how this process generally works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Randomly split our data into training and validation sets\n",

    "\n",
    "2) Come up with a list of values that we want to test for $\\lambda$, our complexity parameter (`sklearn` will often do this for us!)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Train our penalized regression models (one model per value of $\\lambda$) on our training data\n",
    " - The training set will be used to estimate the model parameters $\\beta$ in our penalized regression\n",

    "## Shortcomings of Train/Validate Splits and Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are randomly splitting our data, there's a chance that a random split could result in a biased split. For example, what if we randomly split our data and all of the winners of the Bachelor got put in the validation set? Our model would probably be much worse at predicting who would do well on the show since it would never get to train on any data where it saw a winner! How could we avoid this from happening? We can use something called **cross-validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation addresses this problem by repeating the train/validate split multiple times to lower the chance of a \"bad split\" where we have imbalanced data between the training and validation sets. A common implementation of cross-validation is called K-fold cross validation, where K represents the number of times you repeat this process, and a \"fold\" represents $\\frac{1}{K}$ of your training data:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'images/kfold_cross_validation.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Source](http://ethen8181.github.io/machine-learning/model_selection/model_selection.html) \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, K equals 5. So we first divide the training data into 5 equal groups. Next, we train our model in 4 of the 5 folds and then validate the performance of that model on the 5th fold. We repeat this process 4 more times, rotating which fold will be used as the validation set. Each model you test will be trained K times and thus will have K values of a performance metric (i.e. MSE). You can average each model's K MSE values to get an overall performance score for each model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of this method is that it ensures that each row of our data is used equally in training our model and that we do not end up with a biased validation set. The main drawback is that as you increase K, the time to assess your models' performance will greatly increase since you are training each model K times instead of once."
